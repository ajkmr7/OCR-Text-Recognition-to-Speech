# OCR-Text-Reognition-to-Speech

This app helps to detect text over an image through **OCR** (Optical Character recognition) by capturing it or uploading it from the device and speaks out what's written on it. Visually Impaired People may find this app useful as it says what's written within seconds. For now, it is designed only for English, but it is possible to add all the regional languages.
